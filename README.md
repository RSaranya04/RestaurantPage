# RestaurantPage
The RestaurantDetails website is a cutting-edge platform that uses data from a JSON file to automatically show comprehensive information about different hotels. This project makes use of JavaScript to acquire and render the content dynamically, CSS to provide an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design, and HTML for the webpage's structure. In a smooth and engaging way, users can search for hotels, filter results, and browse comprehensive information about each hotel. The website may be easily updated and maintained without requiring major HTML alterations thanks to the JSON-based data structure.
